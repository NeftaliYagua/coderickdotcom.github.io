# Hey there! I'm Ricardo.
Rick is cool too. I like to solve problems and get ideas of the ground.

Currently I'm working as CTO and co-founder @ [COTOLABS](http://www.cotolabs.com), while working on some  [side projects](/projects) and finish up studying. I have a background in Mechatronics and Mechanical Engineering, am somewhat of a neat freak and have a sincere and public hatred for uncommented and ugly code.

Talk to me about rap/R&B/Hip-Hop, stoner rock, tattoos, running, movies, podcasts, industrial design and user interfaces, code or Reddit.

I work with the full-stack, mostly making web apps in HTML + CSS + Node + Javascript + MongoDB and python. While getting a hang of React & React Native.

 Yet I'm *passionate* about good design and closing deals. I don't really label myself as a developer, **I'm make things happen**.

When I'm not working or studying, I'm probably working out, looking for obscure webpages, watching movies or playing guitar.
