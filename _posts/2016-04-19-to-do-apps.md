**TL;DR:** if you're a developer looking for and idea, jump to the first feature, make that app and proceed to become rich.
***

So far I've tried 43 (I counted) different to-do list apps out there in the iOS appstore.

And not one of them, free or paid, has all the features I'm looking for. I've literally spent *years* searching for that magical one. I'm so frustrated about it that I wrote this blog post with the hopes that some developer reads this, makes the app, becomes a millionaire, then shoots me an email with the title: "hey thanks, here's that app btw".

# The 7 features:

## **1. I need to be able to create a list, use it, and save it to reuse it in the future.**
*This is the holy grail.*
If there is an app that has this feature, and most of the rest, I will pay 3 times the price of any other to-do app out there.

Bonus points: feature to set a deadline to that list and have the tasks automagically create reminders for when each one has to be done in order to fulfill that deadline.

### **2. Do not ask me to make an account.**
I want to write shit and get it done, no facebook/google/linkedin/pinterest integrations either.

### **3. Making recurring tasks is a must and it has to be *easy*.**
And I don't mean daily or weekly, I want to be able to tell the app "remind me this every tuesday and friday this month" . Look at [Due](http://www.dueapp.com/) for the easiest recurring task system out there.

### **4. It needs to have infinite different lists if I choose to create them.**
I don't want to mix work stuff and family stuff.

### **5. It has to nag me until I get a task done indefinitely.**
I'm lazy.

### **6. I need to be able to create a list within a list.**
Some things are more complicated than a grocery list.

### **7. It needs to connect to whatever calendar I use.**
Be it the stock calendar or google calendar, so that if I update it somewhere else the changes appear in the app.

<span style="font-size: 300%; font-weight: bold;">R</span>ight now I'm learning React Native fueled by the anger of not having this app in my phone, but if you want to beat me to it just email me a link so I can give you my money.
